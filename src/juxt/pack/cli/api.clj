  Options:

  Caveats
    - The version of One-Jar is patched to fix miscellaneous bugs
    - This may be replaced with Uno-Jar in the future
    - Classpath scanning mechanisms don't work with One-Jar, as it uses a
      custom URL scheme.

  Options
    :basis - basis to use, if not provided will create a basis without :user
    :jar-file - jar file to create
    :main-class - main class to run jar with default = clojure.main, changing
                  this requires the use of aot and is considered more advanced.
                  Prefer setting :main-opts in your basis and using
                  clojure.main to load your main."
